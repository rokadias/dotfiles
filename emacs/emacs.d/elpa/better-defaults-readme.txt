There are a number of unfortunate facts about the way Emacs works
out of the box. While all users will eventually need to learn their
way around in order to customize it to their particular tastes,
this package attempts to address the most obvious of deficiencies
in uncontroversial ways that nearly everyone can agree upon.

Obviously there are many further tweaks you could do to improve
Emacs, (like those the Starter Kit and similar packages) but this
package focuses only on those that have near-universal appeal.
