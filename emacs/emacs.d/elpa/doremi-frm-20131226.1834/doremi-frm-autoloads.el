(defvar doremi-RGB-increment-factor 1 "\
*Factor to scale up RGB incrementing for some Do Re Mi functions.
Because RGB incrementing is by nature finer scale than HSV
incrementing, some Do Re Mi commands automatically scale up the
incrementing by this factor, so you need not iterate (cycle) so many
times to see an appreciable change.  When this is the case, it is
noted for the individual function.

The scale factor to use depends on how many hex digits there are in
your color representations.  A scale factor of 16 (and an input
increment of 1) means that, for each RGB component, it is the second
component digit from the right, not the rightmost, that is incremented
with each key press.  A factor of 256 means that the third digit from
the right cycles.  The default value is 1: no scaling.

If the digit that would be cycled is greater than the length of your
color components, then no incrementation occurs.  For example, if the
colors you use have the format #RRGGBB, so that each component has two
hex digits, then a factor of 256 is not appropriate, since it leaves
the component value unchanged (wraparound).  In that case, change the
value.

In general, 256 is good for colors represented as #RRRRGGGGBBBB, 16 is
good for #RRRGGGBBB, and 1 (no scaling) is appropriate for #RRGGBB.

What counts is the color representation you use, not what Emacs can
actually display for your screen.  On most platforms, Emacs can really
only display 8-bit color components, so #RRGGBB is the best it can do.
But you might well have defined your colors using the format
#RRRRGGGGBBBB.  That's OK, and it lets you see information reflecting
a more precise correspondance between RGB codes and color names, but
that extra precision is in fact ignored by Emacs and your display.

Personally, I use the longer format, ##RRRRGGGGBBBB, because I like to
see more info about the colors I use, even though my display cannot
really distinguish that many.  I also use libraries `hexrgb.el' and
`palette.el', and I convert color information between various formats
\(RGB, HSV, color names).  So I prefer to use the finer-grained
format, even though I can't see all the differences it provides.
Thus, I customize this option to 256.

The commands that use this option to scale up incrementing do so for
convenience.  You can always use other commands that perform no such
scaling.  For example, `doremi-bg+' scales RGB, but you can use
`doremi-increment-background-color' instead, for finer tuning.")

Change FRAME's background color incrementally.

You are prompted for the color COMPONENT to increment/decrement (a
character):
  `r' - red
  `g' - green
  `b' - blue
  `h' - hue (basic color)
  `s' - saturation (purity)
  `v' - value (brightness)

  `R' - red, green, and blue, at the same time
  `H' - hue, saturation, and value, at the same time

`R' and `H' increment all components of the respective color spaces,
according to the value of INCREMENT.

You can at any time change, to increment/decrement a different color
component (r, g, b, h, s, v, R, or H).  For example, you can type `r'
and use the arrow keys or mouse wheel to change the red component,
then type `b' and use the arrows or wheel to change the blue
component, and so on, all in the same call to `doremi-bg+'.

Tip: To increment or decrement the cyan, magenta, or yellow component,
     just decrement or increment the red, green, or blue component,
     respectively.  CMY is just the opposite direction from RGB.

INCREMENT is the increment to change.  The value can be a number or a
list of 3 numbers.  The default value is 1.  You can use a prefix
argument to specify a number value.  Otherwise, you are prompted to
input the value.

If the value is a list of 3 numbers, they are used to increment the
individual components red, green, and blue, respectively, as well as
hue, saturation, and value, respectively.  If you change the
component(s) to increment, then the original input INCREMENT is
reapplied.

For example, if INCREMENT is (0.2 -0.5 1.1) and the initial COMPONENT
value is `R', then red is incremented by 0.2, green by -0.5, and blue
by 1.1.  If you then hit `h', hue is incremented by 0.2.  If you then
hit `b', blue is incremented by 1.1.

For RGB, INCREMENT is actually multiplied by
`doremi-RGB-increment-factor', for convenience.  If you need finer
control than that provides, use command
`doremi-increment-background-color' to refine the color.  If it seems
that no incrementing occurs, then reduce
`doremi-RGB-increment-factor'.

The initial color value is converted to a hexadecimal RGB (red, green,
blue) string that starts with \"#\".  The initial value is the current
background color of the selected frame.

If `eyedrop-picked-background' is non-nil and you use plain `C-u'
instead of a numeric prefix argument (or, non-interactively, PICKUP-P
is non-nil), then the frame background is first set to the value of
`eyedrop-picked-background'.  This happens only if library
`eyedropper.el' or `palette.el' is loaded.  This lets you pick up a
background color from somewhere, using `eyedrop-pick-background-at-*',
and then use that as the initial value for `doremi-bg+'.

Colors can be expressed in Emacs as color names or hex RGB strings.
Depending on your operating system, the RGB components for a given
Emacs color can have different numbers of hex digits.  For example, on
one system RGB component values might vary from 000 to FFF; on another
system they might vary from 0000 to FFFF.  Incrementing or
decrementing a given color's RGB spec makes it roll over when the
limit (say 000 or FFF) is reached.

As for all Do Re Mi incrementation commands, use
`doremi-boost-up-keys' and `doremi-boost-down-keys' for faster
incrementation.  The change is `doremi-boost-scale-factor' times
faster than for `doremi-up-keys' and `doremi-down-keys'.
