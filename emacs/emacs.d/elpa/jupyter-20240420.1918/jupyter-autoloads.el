Execute Jupyter source blocks that start before point.
Only execute Jupyter source blocks that have the same session.
Non-Jupyter source blocks are evaluated conditionally.

The session is selected in the following way:

   * If `point' is at a Jupyter source block, use its session.

   * If `point' is not at a Jupyter source block, examine the
     source blocks before `point' and ask the user to select a
     session if multiple exist.  If there is only one session, use
     it without asking.

   * Finally, if a session could not be found, then no Jupyter
     source blocks exist before `point'.  In this case, no session
     is selected and all the source blocks before `point' will be
     evaluated, e.g. when all source blocks before `point' are
     shell source blocks.

NOTE: If a session could be selected, only Jupyter source blocks
that have the same session are evaluated *without* evaluating any
other source blocks.  You can also evaluate ANY source block that
doesn't have a Jupyter session by providing a prefix argument.

Jupyter source blocks.

`jupyter-repl-interaction-mode' is enabled in those buffers.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Jupyter-Repl-Persistent mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is
positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable
the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='jupyter-repl-persistent-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.
