This version of mediawiki.el represents a merging of
wikipedia-mode.el (maintained by Uwe Brauer <oub at mat.ucm.es>)
from http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/wikipedia-mode.el for its
font-lock code, menu, draft mode, replying and convenience
functions to produce mediawiki.el 2.0.

Installation

If you use ELPA (http://tromey.com/elpa), you can install via the
M-x package-list-packages interface. This is preferrable as you
will have access to updates automatically.

Otherwise, just make sure this file is in your load-path (usually
~/.emacs.d is included) and put (require 'mediawiki.el) in your
~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el file.
