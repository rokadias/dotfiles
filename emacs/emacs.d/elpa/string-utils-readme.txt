Quickstart

    (require 'string-utils)

    (string-utils-squeeze-filename (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)) 20)

    (string-utils-stringify-anything (selected-frame))

    (progn
      (message (string-utils-pad (buffer-name (current-buffer)) (window-width) 'right))
      (sit-for 1)
      (message (string-utils-pad (buffer-name (current-buffer)) (window-width) 'center))
      (sit-for 1)
      (message (string-utils-pad (buffer-name (current-buffer)) (window-width) 'left))
      (sit-for 1))

Explanation

String-utils is a collection of functions for string manipulation.
This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
for programming in Emacs Lisp.

The following functions are provided:

    `string-utils-stringify-anything'
    `string-utils-has-darkspace-p'
    `string-utils-has-whitespace-p'
    `string-utils-trim-whitespace'
    `string-utils-compress-whitespace'
    `string-utils-string-repeat'
    `string-utils-escape-double-quotes'
    `string-utils-quotemeta'
    `string-utils-pad'
    `string-utils-pad-list'
    `string-utils-propertize-fillin'
    `string-utils-plural-ending'
    `string-utils-squeeze-filename'
    `string-utils-squeeze-url'
    `string-utils-split'
    `string-utils-truncate-to'

To use string-utils, place the string-utils.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'string-utils)

Bugs

    (defun string-utils-test-func nil "doc" (keymap 95))
    (string-utils-stringify-anything (symbol-function 'string-utils-test-func))

    Some objects such as window-configuration are completely
    opaque and won't be stringified usefully.

TODO

    Stringification of autoload data type
        http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Autoload-Type.html

    Maybe args should not be included when stringifying lambdas and
    macros.

    In string-utils-propertize-fillin, strip properties which are
    set to nil at start, which will create more contiguity in the
    result.  See this example, where the first two characters have
    the same properties

        (let ((text "text"))
          (add-text-properties 0 1 '(face nil) text)
          (add-text-properties 2 3 '(face error) text)
          (string-utils-propertize-fillin text 'face 'highlight)
          text)

     String-utils-squeeze-url needs improvement, sometimes using
     two elisions where one would do.
